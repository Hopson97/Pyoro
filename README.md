# Pyoro
C++ w/ SFML (unfinished) attempt at Pyoro

This is a educational non-commerical project for the purpose of getting better at C++.

[Here is a video of creating it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzaj-PKvoLU)

Originally, this was meant be a race with my friend for creating the game "Pyoro".

It a game where you play a bird-like thing and have to collect seeds falling from the sky.

If the seeds touch the tiles, the tile is destroyed. It is game over when you are touched by a seed.

My friend and I thought that it would take only a few hours, maybe one to three maximum. But no, it took so much longer. In fact, after 14+ hours for coding for it in my free time after two weekish, I still had no finished it.

It was a huge eye opener for me. The game looked so simple, but it really wasn't. From here on, all my projects I have worked on for a long time, and have never questioned it.

Here is what it ended up looking like:

You can walk left and right and press Z to fire out your tongue, and the seeds can be collected, and a fancy flashing text showing the score appears for a few seconds.
